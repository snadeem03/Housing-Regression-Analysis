# Housing-Regression-Analysis

## Introduction
 This repository contains a project focused on predicting housing prices in the Boston area using linear regression. The dataset used is the well-known Boston Housing Dataset, which includes various features related to housing characteristics and economic factors.

## Project Overview 
 The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston, represented in $1000s. The model achieves an R2 score of 0.6, meaning it explains 60% of the variance in the housing prices.

## Features
 The Boston Housing Dataset includes the following features:

 * CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
 * ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
 * INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
 * CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
 * NOX: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
 * RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
 * AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
 * DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
 * RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
 * TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
 * PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
 * B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of Black residents by town
 * LSTAT: Percentage of lower status of the population
 * MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (target variable)

## Results
 * Model: Linear Regression
 * RÂ² Score: 0.6
